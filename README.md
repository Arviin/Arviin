## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Arviin/Arviin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I'm a PhD candidate in experimental physics and here I'm sharing some of my works that I have been doing in recent years :),
I have a wide range of skills and experiences, from computational imaging science and material characterization to AI and computer vision ...
Iâ€™m (mainly) working on image and data analysis, I like to put some meaning to numbers ... :)


- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a an Engineer (BSc) and a Physicist (PhD) at the same time :))
